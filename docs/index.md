# Welcome

On this website I'll publish some coding experiences.

Also check my (old) leaflet library [leaflet.offline](https://github.com/allartk/leaflet.offline)

## About me

Coding over 20 years in various programming languages. Currently mosly focussed on:

* Python (fastapi, sqlalchemy)
* Postgres and postgis
* Various geo software
* linux (bash, systemd, mounts, all kinds of configurations etc)
* Typescript
* Cloud (eg containers, kubernetes) on azure
* CI/CD (gitlab, jenkins)

In the past:

* php (symfony, doctrine ORM)
* typescript (react, angular)

But apart from knowing tools and how to solve problems with them, is clean, readable, maintainable code.

I love standards that help with it, clean code guides, and various patterns.
