# Welcome

On this website I'll publish some coding experiences.

Also check my (old) leaflet library [leaflet.offline](https://github.com/allartk/leaflet.offline)

## About me

Coding over 20 years in various programming languages. Currently mosly focussed on:

* Python (fastapi, sqlalchemy)
* Postgres and postgis
* Various geo software
* Some cloud stuff (eg containers, kubernetes) on azure

In the past:

* php (symfony, doctrine)

But apart from the tools, maybe as important is the way you use them. E.g. clean, readable, maintainable code.

I love standards that help with it, clean code guides, and various patterns.
